# GitHub Steps

Describe in your own words how to establish a connection between a local repository and a remote repository on GitHub.
Create the local repository and initialize git. Create the remote repository and copy the SSH code. Then, in the terminal, `use git remote add origin [paste SSH code]` and `git push -u origin main` to connect the local and remote repositories.
